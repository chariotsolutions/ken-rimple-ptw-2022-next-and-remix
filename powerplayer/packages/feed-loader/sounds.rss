      <itunes:summary>The choice of cloud native development tools and platform options have grown exponentially during the past couple of years. But with such a wide range of choices comes uncertainty, and sadly, confusion in many cases when deciding which option represents the best fit for software production pipelines.

Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and vice president of developer relations at the  Linux Foundation,  recently described the state of affairs in the cloud native landscape where there are “at least 20 to 30 tools out there, and it’s constantly growing, with a mix of startups and cloud providers,  as “an opportune time amongst vendors and users to bring sanity to this space.”

Much of this much-needed “sanity” involves the availability of common standards for continuous delivery (CD). To this end, the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) was created to foster collaboration for deployments using Jenkins, Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.

During this podcast episode of The New Stack @ Scale series, Alex Williams, founder and editor-in-chief of The New Stack, discussed CDF’s mission and what the development community can expect.

The podcast discussions recorded at the Open Source Leadership Summit also covered hopes, as well as concerns, about what such a foundation might represent. Other speakers, in addition to Aniszczyk, included:

Matt Klein, a software engineer at Lyft and creator of the Envoy Proxy;
Kit Merker, vice president of business development, at JFrog;
Dan Lorenc, a software engineer on Google’s Cloud Platform;
Kim (Vogt) Lewandowski, a Google product manager.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>We proudly present the third episode of The New Stack @ Scale podcast, our monthly program sponsored by New Relic that explores the issues that come with dynamic services and systems. In this edition, recorded during New Relic’s FutureStack15 User Conference, The New Stack founder Alex Williams was joined by co-anchor Fredric Paul, New Relic’s Editor-in-Chief. They were joined by three guests to discuss the issues around scale and monitoring, with a focus on Docker and containers:

* Karl Matthias manages the Site Services team at New Relic in Portland, Oregon. He the maintainer of Centurion, New Relic’s container production environment, and is co-author of the O’Reilly book “Docker: Up &amp; Running.”
* Tim Gross is a product manager for Joyent, providers of the Triton Elastic Container Service. Not long ago, Tim ran Ops at DramaFever (see Episode 50 of The New Stack Analysts podcast) and, in a previous life, Tim was an architect (buildings, not software).
* Scott M. Fulton III covers Internet-scale software and services development for The New Stack.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>The New Stack @ Scale explores cloud-native architectures, boldly discusses complexity in distributed, scaled-out environments, and ventures deep into monitoring, analytics and open source, all beckoning toward a future of transparency between platforms and the infrastructure itself.

Our mission with The New Stack @ Scale is to address topics of interest to developers, operations managers and business leaders alike, to hear from the industry’s best and most enlightening minds, and to lace these discussions with a variety of featured segments, to create an informative, ambitious show that stands apart from the typical one-mic podcast. The show is co-hosted by The New Stack founder Alex Williams, and New Relic Editor-in-Chief Fredric Paul, a long-time journalist himself.

This second episode, recorded at AWS re:Invent, features two guests who bring a wealth of insight to the conversation:

Dave McRory, CTO of Basho Technologies. Previously, Dave served as SVP of Engineering at Warner Music Group, as well as Senior Architect, Cloud Foundry at VMware, and as a Cloud Solutions Architect at Dell. He is also an inventor, an author, and a founder/CTO of several companies in the virtualization, systems management, and cloud computing spaces.

James Governor, Co-founder of RedMonk, an independent IT research and advisory firm committed to an integrated view of information technologies and enterprise requirements. James is also founder of Shoreditch Works, a coworking space in London with a developer-centric focus.

Later in the show, we hear from CEO John Sheehan about the infrastructure of Runscope, and also Loris Degioanni, founder of sysdig, who speaks to the complexities of the new stack. 

Also, make sure to keep your earbuds in for the bonus section at the end of the podcast. You’ll be treated to a wildly entertaining deconstruction of “Battlestar Galactica” as an allegory about microservices, along with an equally valid analysis using “Star Wars,” the premiere of the soon-to-be-iconic “Parable of The Prize Bull,” and much more.</itunes:summary>
